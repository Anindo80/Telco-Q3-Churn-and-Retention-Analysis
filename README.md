# Telco Q3 Churn and Retention Analysis

## Executive Summary:
Using SQL, Excel, and Python, I analyzed Q3 customer data from a California based home and internet service provider to gain insights about the key contributing factors that drive customers to leave the services. After identifying that competitive products, fiber optic services, Offer E, and month-to-month contracts were the top contributors to churn, I recommend a few adjustments that will lead to a higher retention of customers: 
- Invest in improved products to compete with competitors
- Implement effective customer service training for support & service personnel
- Re-evaluate or phase out high churn contributing services while promoting high retention contributing services

## Business Problem:
As revenue and performance are directly impacted by customer churn, the company is interested in investing the following using the Q3 data for over 7000 customers: 
-	What factors are causing customers to leave
- What kind of correlation exists between customer behavior and churn
-	Implement ways to reduce churn rate and improve retention rate

---

## Methodology:
-	Explored datasets to understand the structure and key data fields required for analysis
-	Performed data cleaning in Excel by checking for duplicates, handling missing values, ensuring data consistency & accuracy through sorting and tabular structuring
-	Extracted, prepared, transformed, and analyzed data using SQL queries
-	Built and evaluated a logistic regression using a ML pipeline, preprocessing, training, and testing data using python libraries to predict customer behavior (churn or stay)
-	Delivered a final presentation including a dashboard and strategic recommendations to maximize customer retention

## Skills:
- Excel: Data Cleaning, Conditional Formatting, Data validation, PivotTables, Pivot Charts, Data visualization
- SQL: Data Extraction, Data Aggregations, Joins, Nested Queries, CTEs, Window Functions
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit learn (sklearn), Logistic Regression model

## Results & Key Findings:
-	Main churn category was competitor which comprised of 45% of the churn that occured
-	Customers in 8 out of the top 10 affected areas reported that competitor had better devices and offers
-	DSL internet type users had the most retention rate of 80.03% while optic fiber users had the most churn rate of 57.87%
-	Customers who tend to use Offer A had the most retention rate of 93.27% while customers using Offer E had the most churn rate of 67.62%
-	Churn rate decreases typically after customers continue services for 12 months

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps:
-	Research current market products and invest in improved devices to compete with competitors
-	Implement effective training for support personnel to offer optimal customer service experience
-	Investigate the optic fiber service and users since they had the highest churn rate, and market the DSL internet service through new promotions as they had the most retention rate
-	Re-evaluate or phase out Offer E as it contributed the most to churn, and promote Offer A which was the best performing offer
-	Switch to annual or long-term contract plans from month-to-month plans 
-	Use a machine learning model to predict customer behavior and identify high risk customers
